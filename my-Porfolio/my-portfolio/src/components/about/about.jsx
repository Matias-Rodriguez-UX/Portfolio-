                                Hello! My name is Matias and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2020, since the covid-19 pandemic, where I began to rethink my current job. I found in remote work and by objectives a way to enjoy the workday.

                                Using my basic career, Industrial Design, and my training as a computer technician, as engines of the future project.

                                I have been training for two years now, taking UX/UI courses, programming logic, web development bootcamps, and finally carrying out complete projects from the Back-End to the Front-End.
